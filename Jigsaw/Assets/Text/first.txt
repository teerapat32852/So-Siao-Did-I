Francis: “Master, here is your medicine, don’t forget to take it.”
Alan: “No, It tastes awful, I don't want to take it.” (pouts)
Francis: “Please take it, master, It is good for your health.” (stern face)
Alan: “Ok, I will. (little sad face)”
Alan: “Francis, did you find my parents. It has been 2 years since…”
Francis: “Master!!(Cold) We agreed that we wouldn’t talk about this anymore.”
Alan: “Ok…(objected)”
Francis: “Good, it is time for you to go to bed.”
Francis: “Good night, Master.”
Alan: “Good night, Francis…”
Alan closes his eyes, Francis is walking out of the room.
Alan: “He’s gone… I cannot sleep, I will go down and read some books.”
