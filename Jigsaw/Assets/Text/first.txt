Francis:“Alan, sir, here is your prescription for today.”
Alan: “But Francis..., I don't want to take it. The medicine tastes awful.”
Francis: “It is vital for your health, sir.”
Alan: “Fine.”
Alan: “Francis..., have you found my parents? It's been two years since..”
Francis: “Alan!! We agreed to never talk about this again.”
Alan: “Alright...”
Francis: “Thank you sir. Well then, I will leave you to rest for now.”
Francis: “Good night, Master.”
Alan: “Good night, Francis…”
Alan closes his eyes, Francis has walked out of the room.
Alan: “He’s gone…, I cannot sleep. Better go downstairs and find something to read.”
