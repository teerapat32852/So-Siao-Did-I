Gabriel:“Master, the story started when you were young.”
Gabriel:“When I came to this house.” 
Gabriel:“I met your parents.” 
Gabriel:“and I found you cute and lively little master.”
Alan:“Gabriel, can you skip to when this thing happened?”
Gabriel:“Patience, master, I want to tell you everything”
Gabriel:“Your parents loved you, master”
Gabriel:“They gave their twilight years” 
Gabriel:“to figure out how to cure the disease in you.”
Alan:“The thing that said about me in the document is this”
Gabriel:“Yes, master”
Alan:“Gabriel, what happened to my mom and dad..”
Gabriel:“I cannot hide it from you, do I?”
Gabriel:“Ok, master”
Gabriel:“Everything happened on your 13th birthday”
Gabriel:“That day, Master and Mistress were working as usual”
Gabriel:“To find a cure for you, young master”
Alan:“I had a picture of something like that earlier today”
Alan:“This is what they were doing...”
Alan:“I was the one who killed them...”
Gabriel:“No master, you did not kill your parents”
Alan:“What are you talking about...”
Alan:“I was the one who pushed them down from the stairs”
Alan:“I saw them lying on the floor”
Gabriel:“Master, listen to me, you were not the one who killed your parents”
Alan:“Then who?”
Gabriel:“Francis killed them”
Alan:“Francis?”
Alan:“But.. Why...?” Crying
Gabriel:“It started when your parents were talking with the lawyer”
Gabriel:“Francis knew the truth that you are sick”
Gabriel:“With your parents protecting you, he couldn’t do anything”
Alan:“Why did he have to do it...”
Gabriel:“Because if you die,” 
Gabriel:“All the treasures in this place will be his by the law”
Alan:“Why did he kill my parents but not me?”
Gabriel:“Because if you die when your parents are alive” 
Gabriel:“That will get Francis arrested immediately”
Gabriel:“And he wouldn’t get a chance to do what he did today”
Alan:“Why, Francis...”
Alan:“I thought he was a good man”
Gabriel:“Yes, he was”
Gabriel:“Before he knew about the treasure”
Alan:“So Gabriel, what does it says in the document”
Gabriel:“Ok master,”
Gabriel:“The document is all about your medical treatment”
Gabriel:“You have suffered a very strange disease”
Gabriel:“That will end up killing you when you are 18 years old”
Gabriel:“Now you do not feel it, and has no idea that it is inside you”
Alan:“So what happened during the treatment?”
Alan:“It said in the document”
Gabriel:“Master, this will sound very scary”
Gabriel:“Your parents used live humans for experimentation” 
Gabriel:“and always ended up killing them”
Gabriel:“And you, master”
Gabriel:“Always sneaking on what they are doing”
Alan:“So that is why I never saw them during the day”
Alan:“Why did they have to do terrible things like that...”
Gabriel:“Because of love master”
Gabriel:“They loved your from the bottom of their hearts”
Alan:“So this is love...” crying and happy
Alan:“Ok Gabriel”
Alan:“I do not want to listen anymore”
